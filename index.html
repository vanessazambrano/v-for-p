       <h2>Vanessa cares about our children's needs. She has made it her priority to supply gear for the boys and girls basketball teams in her neighborhood. As a child, Vanessa, was not able to get the appropriate footware or clothing she disired to play Basketball, this is why she wants to make a differnece for the children out there. Also she has paid out of pocket for essentials such as, sneakers, jerseys, knee pads, and socks, for her All Girls Elemetary Basketball Team, "Genesis". Vanessa spoke to New York times, "Our team is called "Genesis" because it stands for "The Beginning" and this is the beginning of a life time of happiness". Vanessa wants boys and girls everywhere to strive for greatness, and no matter how hard things get, never give up!</h2>
